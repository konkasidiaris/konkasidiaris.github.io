Hello there!  
If "General Kenobi" is what came into your mind, we think alike. I'm Kon, a software engineer from Greece.

## Snapshot

- Software engineer with a background in Chemical Engineering.
- I like building infrastructure and tools that multiply other developers’ impact.
- Bass player (’60s–’90s rock and beyond).
- Martial arts enthusiast (Judo, BJJ).
- Certified scuba diver (up to 18 meters).
- Fridge-magnet collector with souvenirs from 50+ countries.

## How I got into programming

When I was younger, I actually hated programming.  
That had less to do with code and more to do with bad teaching.

I studied Chemical Engineering and my first jobs weren’t about software at all. At some point I had to automate boring, repetitive tasks at work using Python. That "small script to save time" flipped a switch in my head. I realized I enjoyed:

- turning messy, manual processes into reliable tools,
- understanding systems deeply enough to break them down and improve them,
- creating things that other people could actually use.

From there, I moved deliberately toward professional software engineering.

## Today: what I actually do

These days I focus on:

- **Elixir/Phoenix and Go** - mostly for backend and infrastructure.
- **Developer experience** - CI/CD, tooling, and automation that remove friction.
- **Multiplying impact** - I’d rather fix a bottleneck once than watch ten people hit it every day.

I don’t enjoy manual, repetitive work. If something is done more than a couple of times, my instinct is to script it, automate it, or remove the need for it altogether.

## Milestones

- **2005** - First running program in QBasic (rectangle area calculator).
- **2012** - First serious program in FORTRAN 90/95 for computational chemistry.
- **2017** - Automated boring work with Python 3 and fell in love with programming.
- **2018** - First paycheck from code: Java 7 and Groovy 3.
- **2020** - Faced a codebase I truly hated and made it orders of magnitude better (Node.js 14).
- **2021** - First real exposure to CI/CD and cloud-native software.
- **2024** - Left a job to pursue a long-held dream -an intense learning experience that reshaped my priorities.

## How I’m useful in a team

- Debugging performance issues and weird, “this only happens in prod” bugs.
- Owning and improving CI/CD pipelines and build/release workflows.
- Automating everything that doesn’t need a human brain.
- Making code and systems easier to understand for the next person.

## This blog

This blog is my way of giving back to the community that helped me become a software engineer.

Here I:

- document solutions to problems I’ve actually faced,
- write about tools and techniques I find useful,
- use Feynman’s Technique to explain tricky tech, so I understand it better and maybe help someone else.

If you found anything interesting, if you agree or disagree with something I write, or if you just want to say hi, I’d be happy to [receive an email from you](mailto:kkasidiaris@gmail.com).
