<p>Hi, thank you for viewing my profile. I am Konstantinos.</p>
<p>I like software engineering a lot, thus the career change. I also like test driven development, pair programming, coding reviews and agile. The best feeling in the world is seeing a happy customer using a product that I had contributed to its construction.</p>
<p>The tools I use right now are Java, Groovy, Typescript & SQL. In my spare time, I study music -I am a self taught bass player!- and several skills which may help advance my career, such as Computer Science, Clojure & Docker. Indicatively, some books on my bookshelves are Clean Code series by Uncle Bob, The Art of Computer Programming by Donald Knuth, TDD by Kent Beck and Elements of the Theory of Computation by Lewis & Papadimitriou.</p>
<p>If you find something on my site and want to talk about it, email me ðŸ™‚!</p>
