Hi, thanks for visiting my page! I am Konstantinos.

I currently work as a Software Engineer in [Desquared](https://thinkdesquared.com/), located in Athens, Greece.

I studied Chemical Engineering and worked a couple of years on the field (computational chemistry-wastewater treatment-maritime) but it was not my cup of tea.

I like software engineering a lot, thus the career change. I, also, like test driven development, pair programming, coding reviews and agile. The best feeling in the world is seeing a happy customer using a product that I had contributed to its construction.

The tools I use right now are Javascript(Node.js/express), mongodb and heroku. In my spare time, I study music -I am a self taught bass player!- and several skills which may help advance my career, such as Computer Science, Clojure & Docker. Indicatively, some books on my bookshelf are Clean Code series by Uncle Bob, The Art of Computer Programming by Donald Knuth, TDD by Kent Beck and Elements of the Theory of Computation by Lewis & Papadimitriou.

I created this blog for two reasons. Firstly, it is an attempt to apply the Feynman's Technique -retain crucial information and/or knowledge by teaching it using simple terms to another person- over my knowledge of Software Engineering, Computer Science and management. Secondly, I think it is a great way to showcase what I have achieved so far as well as using it as future reference.
