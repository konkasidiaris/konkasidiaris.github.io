## A bit about me (as for 06-01-2020)

I wrote my first program, a hypotenuse calculator, when I was 13 years old in Visual Basic. Did not like it. I have a diploma (BSc and MEng equivalent) in Chemical Engineering. My thesis was on computational chemistry field. I wrote and refactored huge chunks of code in Fortran 90/95. Still did not like it! Later in life, I was a chemical engineer in a company deep in maritime automatons. I gradually fell in love with automating stuff. Less than a year in that company, there was some work to be done, about the online page and e-shop and noone to do it. So, I volunteered and day by day I started adoring programming(!).
Some months later, I attended a local java coding bootcamp. That led to a career change. On July of 2018, I was hired as a Software Engineer in an insurance company in Greece.

## The need for a personal blog

My dream is to become a successful software engineer. The shortcut for learning a new language, framework etc, is to create a simple app with that, isn't it? What about the abstract concepts of computer science, software engineering and management? How could I learn them as fast as I can? The answer is simple. The notorious Feynman's technique. [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) had this peculiar technique where one, in order to understand an aspect, should teach it to another person. It creates this recursive loop where explaining something would require understanding it and vice versa.

## Side effects of blogging

#### Personal growth monitoring

In the past one and a half year of being a developer, I can see that I have become a better developer but what I cannot see or measure is how much of a better engineer-coder-developer I am now. By keeping a blog of my accomplishments, suddenly everything becomes measurable. I am imaging, reading my blog in about a year and there are a couple of dozens of posts! Wow, the progress!!!

#### Prove my expertise

I think this is a common problem among people who do not hold a cs related degree. Every employer demands proven computer science understanding. Also, a single code base cannot tell every problem that I faced while coding neither how I overcame it. Being still a junior developer does not help the negative situation.

#### Motivation to study

In order to be consistent, I shall post regularly thus I shall study regularly thus I will become better engineer quicker.

#### Future reference

There are, far more than I can count, times where I remember that I have studied something, but it takes ages since I recall it 100%. You would think "google it mate" but don't all of us have a unique way of understanding things? My personal notes on this would be more valuable than a stackoverflow post.

#### Feedback

Seriously, I cannot stress enough, how important is feedback. By having even one person email me just to correct something that I -falsy understood and- written would make my instantly a better engineer and in case that I was not wrong in the first place, I will make a new friend.

#### Giving back to community

Contributing to the community is not only on huge awesome open source projects. Sometimes there is a how to YouTube video, correcting a typo in a documentation file or sharing a blog post.

#### Exercise my English

My mother tongue is Greek and there is almost no chance that I would speak English through the day. I mean most of the songs I listen, the movies I watch and the comments in my code are in English but these are nowhere as challenging as writing a 2000 words post, where you know that someone may read it.

#### Awesome factor

It may sound silly but not many developers have their own blog or even a page.

## TL;DR

I want to expand both my hard and soft skills, thus I made a personal blog!
